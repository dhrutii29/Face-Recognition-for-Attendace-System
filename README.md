# Face-Recognition-for-Attendace-System
ML based project

## Introduction
Face recognition algorithms can extract features from a face image namely positions of forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, chin, jaws. 
Face Landmarks – There are 68 specific points (called landmarks) that exist on every face. 
Face Encodings – This is the 128 encoding feature vector from a pretrained network over millions of images. 


## Technology used
Python 3\
SQL


## Libraries
opencv-python\
numpy\
face_recognition\
datetime\
tkinter\
pillow\
mysql-connector-python


## Conclusion
Face recognition library being a high level deep learning library helps in identifying faces accurately. 
We’ve then used this to build a face attendance system which can be helpful in offices, 
schools or any other place reducing manual labour and automatically updating the attendance records in day-to-day life. 
This also notes down the time of arrival thus can acquire information about 
people coming in late after a specified time.
